// CLOUDS:
// [m-z\d@_]{7}
// [a-p\d_@]{8}
// [j-s\d_@]{8}
// [p-x\d_@]{9}
// [e-t_@]{8}

//Step 1.Head over to https://RegEx101.com

//Step 2.In the bar titled 'REGULAR EXPRESSIONS' find the second forward slash towards the end and click to enable the 'i' insensitive flag and disable all others (for this example).

//Step 2.Copy/paste the 'CYLCONE' into the bar titled "TEST STRING" (It's ok if the forward slashes are present).

//Step 3.Nowwww.... If ya will :), copy and paste the FIRST of the CLOUDs listed above ([m-z\d@_]{7}) into the "REGULAR EXPRESSION" bar on top of the page (beware of any whitespaces in the bar).
//A fragment of the CYCLONE should now be... ILLUMINATED ( ◡‿◡ ).

//Step 4.Write down in order from left to right, the characters included in the fragment that are NOT highlighted/targeted by the 'CLOUD'. This should leave you with your first ‘wonderBit’: "ilO"

//Step 5.Move on to the next cloud. Copy/paste it into the “REGULAR EXPRESSION BAR” and follow “Step 4” again :) 

//Step 6. Copy/paste the rest of the 'CLOUDs' into the "REGULAR EXPRESSION" bar ONE BY ONE (in order, without whitespaces) and follow "Step 4" again for each. You should end up with the following 'wonderBits':

//........Cloud 1: "ilO"
//........Cloud 2: "v"
//........Cloud 3: "e"
//........Cloud 4: "yO"
//........Cloud 5: "u"

//Step 7.Piece the 'wonderBits' together, writing them all out in order. This should leave you with our full ‘WONDER!:
